This is a collection of Matlab scripts to help researchers use data available with the peer reviewed article "Low-complexity methods to mitigate the impact of environmental variables on low-cost UAS-based atmospheric carbon dioxide measurements", available via open access at the European Geophysical Union's Atmospheric Measurements Techniques journal.

For an example on how to read the raw data use the script "Executable.m".

OBS: Make sure to edit the path to your data files and to select the correct experiment type by commenting or uncommenting the type variables.
